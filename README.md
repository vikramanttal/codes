This Repo contains various version of Frequency Selective MIMO wireless System.
FreqSelMIMO.m simulates and decodes data using time domain Frequency Selective MIMO wireless channel estimation and equalization.
It further plots the MSE and BER curves for semonstating the performance of these system.

MIMO-OFDM treats the same channel in frequency doamin using fast and efficient fft implementation.
The technology utilized is OFDM which converts the frequency selective channel into flat faded and
exploit the rich conventional techniques for channel estimation and other impairments.

I am sorry, I wrote this in a real hurry. I will try to elaborate this as soon as possible.

Till than.
Thanks
Good Bye
